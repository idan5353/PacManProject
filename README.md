## Overview

**Pac-Man Game** is a classic arcade game deployed on AWS. This project showcases a complete deployment pipeline using modern DevOps practices. It includes provisioning infrastructure with Terraform, creating an EKS cluster, setting up CI/CD pipelines, and deploying a MongoDB StatefulSet.

**Features:**
- Deployed on AWS using Terraform and EKS.
- Exposed via an AWS Load Balancer.
- CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments.
- MongoDB database using StatefulSets and Persistent Volumes.
- Optional Grafana/Prometheus dashboard for cluster monitoring.

## Source Code

The source code for the Pac-Man game can be found here: [Pac-Man GitHub Repository](https://github.com/font/pacman).

## Requirements

### Infrastructure Setup

1. **Terraform**: Ensure you have Terraform installed to provision infrastructure.
2. **AWS CLI**: Configure your AWS CLI with appropriate credentials.
3. **kubectl**: Install kubectl to interact with the EKS cluster.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/font/pacman.git
    cd pacman
    ```

2. **Provision Infrastructure with Terraform:**
    - Navigate to the Terraform directory.
    - Initialize Terraform:
      ```bash
      terraform init
      ```
    - Apply Terraform configurations:
      ```bash
      terraform apply
      ```

3. **Create an EKS Cluster:**
    - Followed the Terraform scripts to set up an EKS cluster with two `t3.medium` worker nodes.

4. **Expose the Application:**
    - Configured the service to use an AWS Load Balancer. Ensured the service configuration file includes the necessary load balancer annotations.

5. **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline:**
    - Implemented a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline - Codebuild to automatically build and deploy EKS workloads.

6. **Deploy MongoDB:**
    - Used Kubernetes StatefulSets and Persistent Volumes to deploy MongoDB. Ensured MongoDB configuration aligns with best practices for high availability and data persistence.

7. **Optional - Monitoring Setup:**
    - Installed Grafana and Prometheus on your EKS cluster.
    - Configured Prometheus to scrape metrics from your Kubernetes nodes and pods.
    - Created Grafana dashboards to visualize CPU, Memory, and Storage utilization.

## Usage

1. Access the Pac-Man game via the AWS Load Balancer URL.
2. Use the arrow keys to navigate Pac-Man through the maze.
3. Collect all pellets and avoid the ghosts to achieve the highest score.
